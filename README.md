# prework-study-guide-excercise-1
#John French.  Bootcamp student
# This is the first exercise with my repository
I have added a README file
I am learning and havent caught everything ....yet!
This is the first exercise, to add a README file
##I will add further parts as the prework requires
# This is the first task, to understand what is required at each stage:
As a boot camp student,
I want a Prework Study Guide website,
so that I can review all the information I learned throughout Prework.
GIVEN a Prework Study Guide website
WHEN I visit the website in my browser
THEN I see four boxes titled HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript with associated notes listed
WHEN I view the study guide
THEN I see a dark blue header and footer, and four boxes with a shadow
WHEN I open the console in my browser
THEN I can see the four topics I learned listed along with a suggestion on what I should study first
WHEN I visit the website using the URL
THEN I can access my website from any browser
Lets code and add the issues!

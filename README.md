# prework-study-guide-excercise-1
# John French.  Bootcamp student
# This is the first exercise with my repository
I have added a README file
I am learning and havent caught everything ....yet!
This is the first exercise, to add a README file
##I will add further parts as the prework requires
# This is the first task, to understand what is required at each stage:
As a boot camp student,
I want a Prework Study Guide website,
so that I can review all the information I learned throughout Prework.
GIVEN a Prework Study Guide website
WHEN I visit the website in my browser
THEN I see four boxes titled HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript with associated notes listed
WHEN I view the study guide
THEN I see a dark blue header and footer, and four boxes with a shadow
WHEN I open the console in my browser
THEN I can see the four topics I learned listed along with a suggestion on what I should study first
WHEN I visit the website using the URL
THEN I can access my website from any browser
Lets code and add the issues!

# Description
## Progress and Motivation
I have read all the instructions several times as I was way behind with the prework.  If I haven't mentioned already I have not been in school for over 40 years so am a little behind in how it works.
I am however very experienced in  logical decision making and electronics despite my lack of computer and coding skills I will continue to read and experiment to get it right.

I was fed up of alwasy asking others for help with my websites.  I have around 4 or 5 for various things from my e-commerce website for my work and several political and community related sites.
I have dabbled with "Opencart", "Wordpress", "Fusion" (back in the day) and more recently "Quark".  None of which have really helped me with the end resualts I wantto achieve.  I am hopeful that this course, despite its fast pace will give me the knowledge I need.

There have been many fundamental points I have learnt in this exercise - first one being MAKE SURE YOU SPELL THINGS RIGHT!!
You may see that I have unfortunately misspelt several sections and as YET do not know how to change them.  As a result I have had to keep using misspelt directories.  I will get that.

From a complete wilderness in web design I have learned some very basic but useful terms for HTML, CSS, GIT and a small, small part about Javascript.  My success at moving files in and around Gitbash on my PC and to Github were celebrations.  I now know how to push/ pull and even do the "Hokey Cokey".  I had never needed this function or saw the use, but as more challenges come I can see the benefit of sharing information and resourses to get a speedier solution.

## Installation
Installation guidance is not applicable as this is an assignment

## Usage
You can open this web page in chrome 
You can use the web developer tools associated with Google Chrome either by right cliocking on your mouse and choosing "inspect" opr by short cut keys Control+shift++I. I still prefer the right click option.
Once you see the Dev tools choose the "console" tab to see the javascript which has been added
This javascript has no interactive function yet as requires more coding, unless I have not added the full comoliment of coding required.

## Credits
No credits applicable except for my own personal comments, and the respective artists for such.

I have learnt an awful lot in a very short space of time, even more than in the book "Web Development and Design", authored by James Webb.  Where all the elements he discusses have been quickly presented into a working project.

A pause for thought.  I am beginning to realise that web coding is a bit like creating a marvelous hit record.  It could be like Ed Shearan (Sorry if you have never heard of him), with beautiful lyrics and just a guitar for company, OR it could be something like Earth Wind and Fire with their hit "Boogie Wonderland", where there seem to be around 20+ people all doing their own thing on stage, banging drums, singing, dancing, taking centre stage and in reality it looks like TOTAL CHAOS, but one fundamental thing remains - the song is a hit.
My analogy is thus - one can right simple workable code that performs or you can have a myriad of differing codes and functions to give mostly the same result.
My preference is to keep things simple, but sometimes you might need someone to jump into your "stage" and bang a drum.
